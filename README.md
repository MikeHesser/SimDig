# SimDig

SimDig is a simulation system for simple digital circuits. It was written in Turbo Pascal in 1992 as part of a school project.

A graphical interface allows you to place logic gates on a board and simulate them. 

In order to run SimDig you need a DOS-Emulation environment like DOSBox (https://www.dosbox.com).
